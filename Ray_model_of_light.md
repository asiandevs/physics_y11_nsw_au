# Exercise


## 10.1 (a).3 – Ray Striking Plane Mirror at 30°

### **Concepts**

* Law of Reflection: $\theta_i = \theta_r$
* Plane mirrors form virtual images equidistant from the mirror

### **Diagram Instructions**

1. Draw a vertical mirror line.
2. Mark a point (object) on one side.
3. Draw an incident ray at $30^\circ$ to the normal.
4. Reflect the ray at $30^\circ$ on the opposite side.
5. Extend the reflected ray backward to locate the image.

### **Conclusion**

The object and its image are symmetric about the mirror plane.

### **Answer Box**

**The image and the object are equidistant from the mirror, confirmed using the law of reflection and ray diagram at $\theta_i = 30^\circ$.**

## 10.1 (a).6 – Minimum Mirror Height for Full Reflection

### **Concepts**

* Geometry of reflection: rays from head and feet must reflect into the eyes
* Eyes are 160 cm above ground

### **Calculation**

* Height of mirror = half the height between eyes and feet

$$
\text{Required mirror height} = \frac{160\ \text{cm} - 0\ \text{cm}}{2} = 80\ \text{cm}
$$

### **Conclusion**

Only a mirror 80 cm high is needed, starting from eye level down.

### **Answer Box**

**The shortest mirror required is 80 cm, beginning at the eye level.**

---

## 10.1 (b).4 – Concave Mirror Image Distance (Focal Length 10 cm, Object Distance 20 cm)

### **Concepts**

* Mirror equation:

$$
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{u} + \frac{1}{v}
$$

(Conventions: $f > 0$ for concave, $u > 0$, image distance $v$ to be found)

### **Calculation**

$$
\frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{20} + \frac{1}{v} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{10} - \frac{1}{20} = \frac{2 - 1}{20} = \frac{1}{20} \Rightarrow v = 20\ \text{cm}
$$

### **Conclusion**

The image is real, inverted, and located 20 cm from the mirror on the same side as the object.

### **Answer Box**

**The image is 20 cm in front of the mirror; it is real and inverted.**

---

## 10.1 (b).5 – Scale Drawing for Concave Mirror (f = 20 cm, u = 10 cm)

### **Concepts**

* Ray diagram rules for concave mirrors
* Object within focal length produces virtual image

### **Diagram Instructions**

1. Draw principal axis.
2. Place object 10 cm from mirror (inside focal length of 20 cm).
3. Use rays: one parallel (reflects through focus), one through center (reflects on same path).

### **Conclusion**

Image is:

* Virtual
* Upright
* Magnified
* On same side as object

### **Answer Box**

**The image is virtual, upright, magnified, and located behind the mirror.**

---

## 10.1 (b).6 – Converging Lens Image (f = 10 cm, u = 35 cm, h = 15 cm)

### **Concepts**

* Lens formula:

$$
\frac{1}{f} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{u}
$$

* Magnification:

$$
M = \frac{v}{u},\quad h' = M \cdot h
$$

### **Calculation**

$$
\frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{v} - \frac{1}{35} \Rightarrow \frac{1}{v} = \frac{1}{10} + \frac{1}{35} = \frac{7 + 2}{70} = \frac{9}{70} \Rightarrow v \approx 7.78\ \text{cm}
$$

$$
M = \frac{7.78}{35} \approx 0.222,\quad h' = 15 \times 0.222 \approx 3.33\ \text{cm}
$$

### **Conclusion**

The image is real, inverted, reduced, and located on the opposite side of the lens.

### **Answer Box**

**Image is real, inverted, \~7.78 cm away, and \~3.33 cm tall.**

## 10.2.7a – Refraction of Light from Air to Glass

### **Concepts**

* Snell’s Law:

$$
n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2
$$

### **Calculation**

$$
n_{\text{air}} = 1.00,\quad n_{\text{glass}} = 1.49,\quad \theta_1 = 30.0^\circ \\
\sin \theta_2 = \frac{n_1}{n_2} \sin \theta_1 = \frac{1.00}{1.49} \times \sin(30^\circ) = \frac{1.00}{1.49} \times 0.5 \approx 0.3356 \\
\theta_2 = \sin^{-1}(0.3356) \approx 19.6^\circ
$$

### **Conclusion**

The angle of refraction is smaller than the angle of incidence when light enters a denser medium.

### **Answer Box**

**Angle of refraction is approximately $19.6^\circ$.**

---

## 10.2.7b – Refraction When Glass is in Oil

### **Concepts**

* Snell’s Law applies again
* Oil is denser than air but less than glass

### **Calculation**

$$
n_{\text{oil}} = 1.28,\quad n_{\text{glass}} = 1.49,\quad \theta_1 = 30^\circ \\
\sin \theta_2 = \frac{1.28}{1.49} \cdot \sin(30^\circ) = \frac{1.28}{1.49} \cdot 0.5 \approx 0.4295 \\
\theta_2 = \sin^{-1}(0.4295) \approx 25.5^\circ
$$

### **Comparison Table**

| Medium Entering From | Refracted Angle (°) |
| -------------------- | ------------------- |
| Air                  | 19.6                |
| Oil                  | 25.5                |

### **Conclusion**

Refraction angle increases when entering glass from oil instead of air.
