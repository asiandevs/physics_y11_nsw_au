## üîπ Section 7.5

### 2. Displacement vs Position Graph

#### **Concepts**
- Transverse waves oscillate perpendicular to energy travel direction.
- Wavelength (Œª): distance between two successive crests/troughs.
- Amplitude (A): max displacement from the rest position.

#### **Wave Details**
| Wave | Amplitude (cm) | Wavelength (cm) |
|------|----------------|-----------------|
| A    | 3              | 8               |
| B    | 1.5            | 8               |

#### **Answer Box**
> **Wave A:** Amplitude = **3 cm**, Wavelength = **8 cm**  
> **Wave B:** Amplitude = **1.5 cm**, Wavelength = **8 cm**  
> *(Both waves share wavelength; B has half the amplitude of A.)*

### 3a. Why doesn‚Äôt a displacement vs time graph show wavelength?

#### **Concepts**
- Time graphs track how a point moves over time, not space.
- Wavelength is a spatial property.

#### **Answer Box**
> **A displacement-time graph does not show wavelength** because it represents oscillations at a single location, not variation across distance.

### 3b. What extra information is needed to calculate wavelength?

#### **Concepts**
- Wave speed formula: `v = f √ó Œª`
- Need frequency (f) and wave speed (v).

#### **Answer Box**
> To find wavelength, you need either the **wave speed (v)** or the **frequency (f)** in addition to the time graph data.

### 4. Why wavelength decreases if wave slows and frequency remains constant

#### **Concepts**
- `v = f √ó Œª`
- If speed decreases and frequency stays constant: Œª must decrease.

#### **Calculation**
If `v ‚Üì` and `f` is constant ‚Üí `Œª = v / f ‚Üì`

#### **Answer Box**
> **Wavelength must decrease** if a wave slows down and its frequency remains constant, based on the equation `Œª = v / f`.

### 5. Calculate speed from frequency and wavelength

#### **Given**
- `f = 2.00 √ó 10¬≥ Hz`
- `Œª = 7.50 √ó 10‚Åª¬π m`

#### **Calculation**
```text
v = f √ó Œª = (2.00 √ó 10¬≥ Hz)(0.750 m) = 1.50 √ó 10¬≥ m/s
````

#### **Answer Box**

> **Wave speed = 1.50 √ó 10¬≥ m/s** (3 significant figures)

### 6. Frequency from period

#### **Given**

* `T = 2.00 √ó 10‚Åª¬≤ s`

#### **Calculation**

```text
f = 1 / T = 1 / (2.00 √ó 10‚Åª¬≤ s) = 50.0 Hz
```

#### **Answer Box**

> **Frequency = 50.0 Hz**


## üîπ Chapter Review Questions

### 5. Find wavelength: `v = 240 m/s`, `f = 480 Hz`

#### **Calculation**

```text
Œª = v / f = 240 / 480 = 0.500 m
```

#### **Answer Box**

> **Wavelength = 0.500 m**

### 6. Why sound travels faster in water than in air

#### **Concepts**

* Speed of sound depends on medium‚Äôs **elasticity** and **density**.
* Water has much higher stiffness (bulk modulus) than air.

#### **Answer Box**

> **Sound travels faster in water** because its **higher stiffness** outweighs its density, allowing faster energy transfer between particles.

### 7. Classify waves as mechanical/electromagnetic & transverse/longitudinal

#### **Wave Classification**

| Example                          | Type            | Direction      |
| -------------------------------- | --------------- | -------------- |
| a) P wave (seismic)              | Mechanical      | Longitudinal   |
| b) Rayleigh wave (surface quake) | Mechanical      | Both (complex) |
| c) Wind-driven water wave        | Mechanical      | Transverse     |
| d) Visible light from Sun        | Electromagnetic | Transverse     |
| e) Trombone sound                | Mechanical      | Longitudinal   |

#### **Answer Box**

> Waves are classified above by whether they require a medium (mechanical) and their motion type (transverse or longitudinal).

### 8. Two waves with different Œª at same speed ‚Üí frequencies must differ

#### **Concepts**

* `v = f √ó Œª` ‚áí if `v` constant and `Œª‚ÇÅ ‚â† Œª‚ÇÇ`, then `f‚ÇÅ ‚â† f‚ÇÇ`

#### **Calculation**

```text
f‚ÇÅ = v / Œª‚ÇÅ,  f‚ÇÇ = v / Œª‚ÇÇ ‚Üí If Œª differs, f must differ.
```

#### **Answer Box**

> **Frequencies must differ** if wavelengths differ at constant wave speed, per `f = v / Œª`.

### 9. Show that `T = 1/f` gives correct units

#### **Concepts**

* Frequency: Hz = s‚Åª¬π
* Period: time = s

#### **Dimensional Check**

```text
T = 1 / f ‚Üí T = 1 / (s‚Åª¬π) = s ‚úÖ
```

#### **Answer Box**

> **Formula `T = 1/f` is correct**, as it results in units of seconds (s) for period.

- Time-distance relationship for electromagnetic radiation
- Light as information carrier across cosmic distances

### Calculation
Distance calculation:
$$d = c \times t$$

Where:
- $c = 3 \times 10^8 \text{ m s}^{-1}$
- $t = 100 \times 10^6 \text{ years} = 100 \times 10^6 \times 365.25 \times 24 \times 3600 \text{ s}$

$$t = 3.16 \times 10^{15} \text{ s}$$

$$d = 3 \times 10^8 \times 3.16 \times 10^{15} = 9.48 \times 10^{23} \text{ m}$$

This equals approximately 100 light-years.

### Constraints

- Neglects gravitational lensing effects
- Ignores cosmic expansion over this timeframe

### Conclusion
Light carries information about the star's past state. We see the star as it existed 100 million years ago, not its current state.

## Question 7
**Light from a blue star has wavelength 410 nm. Find its frequency given c = 3 √ó 10‚Å∏ m s‚Åª¬π.**

## Question 9
**Which sound wave property produces voltage fluctuations in a microphone diaphragm?**

### Concepts
- Sound waves create pressure variations
- Microphone diaphragm responds to pressure changes
- Amplitude relates to sound intensity/loudness
- Pressure amplitude drives mechanical displacement

### Calculation
The relationship between sound pressure and diaphragm displacement:
$$F = P \times A$$

Where:
- $F$ = force on diaphragm
- $P$ = sound pressure amplitude
- $A$ = diaphragm area

The voltage output is proportional to diaphragm displacement, which depends on pressure amplitude.

### Constraints

- Sensitivity depends on microphone design
- Background noise affects minimum detectable amplitude

### Conclusion
The amplitude (or intensity) of the sound wave determines the magnitude of pressure variations, which directly controls the voltage fluctuations in the microphone.

**Answer Box: The amplitude of the sound wave produces sympathetic voltage fluctuations in the microphone**

---

## Question 10
**CRO trace shows sound wave with 0.001s per division time base. Is wave velocity constant?**

### Concepts
- Wave velocity depends on medium properties
- Frequency and wavelength can vary independently
- CRO displays pressure variations over time
- Velocity = frequency √ó wavelength

### Calculation
Without the actual figure, we can analyze generally:

If the trace shows regular, repeating patterns with consistent spacing, then:
- Period $T$ remains constant
- Frequency $f = \frac{1}{T}$ remains constant

For velocity to be constant:
$$v = f\lambda = \text{constant}$$

This requires both frequency and wavelength to remain constant, or their variations to be inversely proportional.

### Constraints
- Air temperature, humidity, and pressure affect sound speed
- CRO only shows temporal variations, not spatial wavelength
- Cannot determine wavelength from time-domain display alone

### Conclusion
The CRO trace alone cannot determine if wave velocity is constant, as it only shows frequency information, not wavelength.

**Answer Box: Cannot determine velocity constancy from CRO trace alone - need both frequency and wavelength information**

### Calculation
Given:
- Sound speed: $v = 330 \text{ m s}^{-1}$
- Frequency: $f = 256 \text{ Hz}$

Using wave equation:
$$\lambda = \frac{v}{f}$$

Substituting values:
$$\lambda = \frac{330}{256} = 1.29 \text{ m}$$

### Comparison
| Musical Note | Frequency (Hz) | Wavelength (m) |
|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Middle C    | 256           | 1.29           |
| A above C   | 440           | 0.75           |
| Low C       | 128           | 2.58           |

### Constraints
- Assumes standard air conditions (0¬∞C)
- Sound speed varies with temperature: $v = 331 + 0.6T$ (where T in ¬∞C)
- Humidity effects are minimal for audible frequencies

### Conclusion
The wavelength of 1.29 m means this sound wave spans more than a meter in air, which is typical for mid-range audio frequencies.

**Answer Box: The wavelength is 1.29 m**

- Compression and rarefaction identification
- Scale drawing requirements

### Calculation
First, find the wavelength:
$$\lambda = \frac{v}{f} = \frac{330}{100} = 3.3 \text{ m}$$

For 2 complete wavelengths (2 compressions + 2 rarefactions):
Total distance = $2\lambda = 6.6 \text{ m}$

### Scaled Diagram
Using 1 cm = 0.5 m scale:

```
|‚Üê‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî 6.6 cm ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Üí|

C    R    C    R

3.3cm intervals

Legend:
C = Compression (wavefronts close together)
R = Rarefaction (wavefronts far apart)
‚Üí = Direction of wave propagation

```

### Constraints
- Wavefront spacing represents pressure variations
- Actual sound waves are 3D, diagram shows 2D cross-section
- Scale must accommodate classroom/paper limitations

### Conclusion
The diagram shows how longitudinal sound waves propagate through air with alternating high and low pressure regions.

**Answer Box: Wavelength = 3.3 m; diagram shows 2 compressions and 2 rarefactions over 6.6 m distance with appropriately spaced wavefront lines**

# Summary

## Fundamental Wave Concepts

### Wave Classification

Waves are categorized into two fundamental types based on their propagation requirements:

**Mechanical Waves**
- Consist of particles with energy that require a medium for propagation
- Examples include sound waves, water waves, and seismic waves
- Energy is transported through the medium while particles oscillate around equilibrium positions
- The medium itself does not travel with the wave

**Electromagnetic Waves**
- Do not require a medium for propagation and can travel through vacuum
- Can be modeled as electric and magnetic fields oscillating perpendicular to each other
- All electromagnetic waves travel at the speed of light in vacuum: $c = 3.0 \times 10^8 \text{ m s}^{-1}$
- Form the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from radio waves to gamma rays

### Wave Motion Components

Every wave consists of two distinct motions:

1. **Uniform Motion**: Movement in the direction of wave travel, representing the direction of energy transfer
2. **Vibrational Motion**: Oscillation of particles or fields about an equilibrium or central point

### Wave Types by Vibration Direction

**Transverse Waves**
- Vibration occurs at right angles (90¬∞) to the direction of propagation
- Particles move up-and-down or side-to-side as the wave passes
- Reflection properties:
  - Reflect upright at a free end
  - Reflect inverted at a fixed end

**Longitudinal Waves**
- Vibration occurs in the same direction as wave propagation
- Particles move back-and-forth parallel to wave direction
- Create compressions and rarefactions in the medium

## Wave Characteristics and Properties

### Fundamental Relationships

All waves, both transverse and longitudinal, obey the fundamental wave equation:
$$v = f\lambda$$

Where:
- $v$ = wave speed (velocity)
- $f$ = frequency
- $\lambda$ = wavelength

The frequency-period relationship:
$$f = \frac{1}{T}$$

Where $T$ = period (time for one complete oscillation)

### Measurable Wave Properties

| Property | Symbol | Definition | Units |
|----------|--------|------------|-------|
| Speed | $v$ | Rate of wave propagation | m s‚Åª¬π |
| Wavelength | $\lambda$ | Distance between consecutive identical points | m |
| Frequency | $f$ | Number of complete oscillations per second | Hz |
| Period | $T$ | Time for one complete oscillation | s |
| Amplitude | $A$ | Maximum displacement from equilibrium | m |
| Wave number | $k$ | Number of wavelengths per unit distance | m‚Åª¬π |

### Key Wave Principles

**Energy Transfer Without Matter Transfer**
- Waves transmit energy from one location to another
- The medium particles oscillate but do not travel with the wave
- Energy flows in the direction of wave propagation

**Particle Displacement**
- Displacement refers to a particle's distance from its rest position as a wave passes
- Maximum displacement equals the wave amplitude

## Wave Representation and Graphs

### Displacement-Time Graphs
- Represent wave behavior as a function of time for a specific location
- Show the wave's **period** ($T$) and **amplitude** ($A$)
- Useful for analyzing wave motion at a fixed point in space

### Displacement-Position Graphs
- Represent wave behavior as a function of position at a specific moment in time
- Show the wave's **wavelength** ($\lambda$) and **amplitude** ($A$)
- Provide a "snapshot" of the wave pattern across space

### Graph Analysis Summary

| Graph Type | Shows Period | Shows Wavelength | Shows Amplitude |
|------------|--------------|------------------|-----------------|
| Displacement vs Time | ‚úì | ‚úó | ‚úì |
| Displacement vs Position | ‚úó | ‚úì | ‚úì |

## Practical Applications

### Problem-Solving Strategy

1. **Identify the wave type** (mechanical/electromagnetic, transverse/longitudinal)
2. **List known quantities** (frequency, wavelength, speed, etc.)
3. **Apply fundamental equations**: $v = f\lambda$ and $f = \frac{1}{T}$
4. **Consider physical constraints** (medium properties, boundary conditions)
5. **Verify units** and check answer reasonableness

### Common Wave Speeds
- Sound in air (20¬∞C): ~343 m s‚Åª¬π
- Light in vacuum: 3.0 √ó 10‚Å∏ m s‚Åª¬π
- Water waves: varies with depth and wavelength
- Seismic waves: varies with rock type and depth

## Chapter Key Takeaways

**Essential Understanding:**
- Waves are energy transfer mechanisms that don't transport matter
- All waves follow the fundamental relationship $v = f\lambda$
- Wave classification depends on medium requirements and vibration direction
- Graphical analysis reveals different wave characteristics depending on the axes chosen

**Mathematical Relationships:**
$$v = f\lambda \quad \text{and} \quad f = \frac{1}{T}$$

**Physical Insight:**
Wave phenomena govern countless natural processes, from sound communication to electromagnetic radiation, making wave theory fundamental to understanding physics across multiple scales and applications.
