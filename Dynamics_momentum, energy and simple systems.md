### **Question:**
When a book falls to the ground, Earth theoretically experiences a velocity change of Δv_Earth = -1.6 × 10⁻²⁴ m/s (negative sign indicating opposite direction to the book's motion). Explain why this change is unobservable in practice.

### **Solution:**

**Key Concepts:**
1. **Newton's Third Law:** The Earth experiences an equal and opposite momentum change to the falling book.
2. **Conservation of Momentum:** Total system momentum (book + Earth) remains zero.

**Step-by-Step Analysis:**

1. **Momentum Calculation:**
   - For a 1 kg book falling at 9.8 m/s:
     ```
     p_book = m × v = 1 kg × 9.8 m/s = 9.8 kg·m/s (downward)
     p_Earth = -p_book = -9.8 kg·m/s (upward)
     ```
   - Earth's mass (M_Earth) = 5.97 × 10²⁴ kg
   - Earth's velocity change:
     ```
     Δv_Earth = p_Earth / M_Earth = -9.8 / (5.97 × 10²⁴) ≈ -1.6 × 10⁻²⁴ m/s
     ```

2. **Practical Observability:**
   | Phenomenon                  | Typical Velocity       | Comparison Factor |
   |-----------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
   | Earth's movement             | 1.6 × 10⁻²⁴ m/s       | 1                 |
   | Human hair growth            | ~10⁻⁹ m/s             | 10¹⁵ × larger     |
   | Continental drift            | ~10⁻⁹ m/s             | 10¹⁵ × larger     |
   | Best lab measurements (LIGO) | ~10⁻¹⁸ m/s            | 10⁶ × larger      |

3. **Physical Constraints:**
   - **Time Requirement:** To move 1 atomic diameter (≈10⁻¹⁰ m):
     ```
     t = distance/velocity = 10⁻¹⁰ m / 1.6 × 10⁻²⁴ m/s ≈ 6 × 10¹³ s (~2 million years)
     ```
   - **Energy Scale:** Kinetic energy transferred to Earth:
     ```
     KE = ½ × (5.97 × 10²⁴ kg) × (1.6 × 10⁻²⁴ m/s)² ≈ 7.6 × 10⁻²⁴ J
     ```

**Conclusion:**
The velocity change is unobservable because:
1. **Scale Disparity:** 15 orders of magnitude below measurable thresholds
2. **Temporal Limits:** Requires geological timescales for detectable displacement
3. **Energy Sensitivity:** Far below quantum fluctuation levels (≈10⁻⁹ J)

### **Final Answer:**
The Earth's velocity change of **1.6 × 10⁻²⁴ m/s** is theoretically valid but practically unobservable due to:
1. Extreme mass ratio between Earth and everyday objects
2. Being **10⁶ times smaller** than the most sensitive instruments can detect
3. Complete masking by natural background vibrations

### **Question 4:**
Imagine you're standing on frictionless ice. You throw a 58 g tennis ball at 12 m/s. Calculate your recoil speed if your mass is 55 kg.

### **Solution:**
**Given:**
- Ball mass (m₁) = 58 g = 0.058 kg
- Ball velocity (v₁) = 12 m/s
- Your mass (m₂) = 55 kg
- Your velocity (v₂) = ?

**Concept:**
Conservation of momentum (initial momentum = 0)

**Calculation:**
```
m₁v₁ + m₂v₂ = 0
(0.058 × 12) + (55 × v₂) = 0
0.696 + 55v₂ = 0
v₂ = -0.696 / 55
v₂ ≈ -0.0127 m/s
```

**Final Answer:**
You recoil at **0.013 m/s** (opposite to ball's direction).

### **Question 5:**
A 2500 kg SUV (north at 15 m/s) collides with a 1500 kg car (east at 20 m/s). The vehicles stick together. Calculate the wreckage's velocity (magnitude and direction).

### **Solution:**
**Given:**
- SUV: m₁ = 2500 kg, v₁ = 15 m/s (north)
- Car: m₂ = 1500 kg, v₂ = 20 m/s (east)

**Step 1: Calculate x- and y-momentum components**
```
p_x = m₂v₂ = 1500 × 20 = 30,000 kg·m/s (east)
p_y = m₁v₁ = 2500 × 15 = 37,500 kg·m/s (north)
```

**Step 2: Resultant momentum**
```
p_total = √(p_x² + p_y²) = √(30,000² + 37,500²) ≈ 48,000 kg·m/s
```

**Step 3: Final velocity**
```
v = p_total / (m₁ + m₂) = 48,000 / (2500 + 1500) = 12 m/s
```

**Step 4: Direction**
```
θ = tan⁻¹(p_y/p_x) = tan⁻¹(37,500/30,000) ≈ 51.3° north of east
```

**Final Answer:**
The wreckage moves at **12 m/s** at **51° north of east**.

### **Question 2:**
A blue and red billiard ball of equal mass roll directly towards each other at 2.0 m/s. Describe their motion after an elastic collision.

### **Solution:**
**Given:**
- Equal masses (m_blue = m_red = m)
- Initial velocities: v_blue = +2.0 m/s, v_red = -2.0 m/s
- Elastic collision (KE and momentum conserved)

**For elastic collisions with equal masses:**
1. Particles exchange velocities
2. Total momentum remains zero

**Final velocities:**
```
v_blue' = v_red = -2.0 m/s (moves left)
v_red' = v_blue = +2.0 m/s (moves right)
```

**Final Answer:**
After collision:
- Blue ball moves left at **2.0 m/s**
- Red ball moves right at **2.0 m/s**

### **Question 3:**
A neutron (mass m) collides elastically with a carbon nucleus (mass 12m) initially at rest. Neutron's initial speed: 1.5 × 10⁷ m/s.

**Part (a):** Calculate final speeds

### **Solution:**
**Elastic collision equations:**
1. v₁' = [(m₁ - m₂)/(m₁ + m₂)]v₁
2. v₂' = [2m₁/(m₁ + m₂)]v₁

**Calculations:**
```
v_neutron' = [(m - 12m)/(m + 12m)] × 1.5 × 10⁷
           = (-11/13) × 1.5 × 10⁷ ≈ -1.27 × 10⁷ m/s

v_carbon' = [2m/(m + 12m)] × 1.5 × 10⁷
          = (2/13) × 1.5 × 10⁷ ≈ 0.23 × 10⁷ m/s
```

**Final Answer (a):**
- Neutron: **1.3 × 10⁷ m/s** (opposite direction)
- Carbon nucleus: **2.3 × 10⁶ m/s**

**Part (b):** Fraction of KE transferred

**Calculation:**
```
KE_initial = ½m(1.5 × 10⁷)²
KE_transferred = ½(12m)(2.3 × 10⁶)²
Fraction = (12 × (2.3)²)/(1.5 × 10⁷)² ≈ 0.28
```

**Final Answer (b):**
**28%** of neutron's KE is transferred

### **Question 4:**
Marcus throws a superball (5.0 m/s downward) from 1.5 m height.

**Part (a):** Impact speed

### **Solution:**
```
v² = u² + 2as
v² = (5.0)² + 2(9.8)(1.5) = 25 + 29.4 = 54.4
v ≈ 7.4 m/s
```

**Final Answer (a):**
Hits ground at **7.4 m/s**

**Part (b):** Rebound speed  
*(Assuming perfect elastic collision)*  
**7.4 m/s** upward

**Part (c):** Maximum height  
```
v² = u² + 2as ⇒ 0 = (7.4)² - 2(9.8)h
h ≈ 2.8 m (above ground)
```

**Part (d):** Assumptions  
1. No air resistance  
2. Perfectly elastic collision with ground  
3. Constant g = 9.8 m/s²  
4. No energy loss to sound/heat

### **Question 5:**
Spacecraft (500 kg) slingshot around Mercury: 3.5 km/s → 110 km/s.

**Part (a):** Mercury's orbital speed

### **Solution:**
**Elastic collision equations:**
v₁' = 110 km/s = [ (m - M)/(m + M) ]v₁ + [ 2M/(m + M) ]v₂  
(Assume Mercury's mass M ≫ m)

**Solving gives:**
v_Mercury ≈ **106.5 km/s**

**Part (b):** KE comparison  
```
KE_initial = ½ × 500 × (3500)² ≈ 3.06 × 10⁹ J  
KE_final = ½ × 500 × (110,000)² ≈ 3.03 × 10¹² J  
```

**Part (c):** Energy source  
The KE gain comes from Mercury's orbital energy, though Mercury's enormous mass makes this change negligible.

Here are the solutions following the standardized format:

### **Question 2:**
Explain why it is desirable to have a crumple zone in a vehicle.

### **Solution:**
**Key Physics Principle:**
Impulse-Momentum Theorem (FΔt = mΔv)

**Purpose of Crumple Zones:**
1. **Increases Collision Time (Δt):**
   - Extends the duration of impact from ~0.1s to ~0.3s
   - Example: For a 1500 kg car at 60 km/h (16.67 m/s):
     ```
     Without crumple: F = (1500×16.67)/0.1 ≈ 250,000 N
     With crumple: F = (1500×16.67)/0.3 ≈ 83,000 N
     ```

2. **Reduces Peak Force:**
   - 3× longer collision time means ≈3× smaller average force
   - Directly decreases injury risk (a = F/m)

3. **Energy Absorption:**
   - Converts kinetic energy into deformation work
   - Prevents energy transfer to passengers

**Final Answer:**
Crumple zones are essential because they **reduce impact forces by extending collision time**, significantly improving occupant safety during crashes.

**Part (b):** Velocity change

### **Solution:**
```
J = mΔv ⇒ Δv = J/m
= 2000/100
= 20 m/s
```

**Final Answer (b):**
Velocity increases by **20 m/s**

### **Solution:**
1. Impulse:
```
J = 25 N × 3.0 s = 75 N·s
```
2. Velocity change:
```
Δv = 75/50 = 1.5 m/s
```

```
v_f = 4.5 + 1.5 = 6.0 m/s
```

**Final Answer (a):**
Final speed = **6.0 m/s**

**Part (b):** Time needed with 75 N force

### **Solution:**
```
Required Δv remains 1.5 m/s
J = mΔv = 50×1.5 = 75 N·s
Δt = J/F = 75/75 = 1.0 s
```

**Final Answer (b):**
Required time = **1.0 s**

### **Question 5:**
58 g tennis ball at 30 m/s is returned by racquet.

**Part (a):** Impulse from graph  
*(Note: Graph data needed for exact calculation. Typical pro tennis impact shows:)*  
```
Average F ≈ 100 N over Δt ≈ 0.005 s
J = FΔt = 100 × 0.005 = 0.5 N·s
```

**Final Answer (a):**
Impulse ≈ **0.5 N·s** (using typical values)

**Part (b):** Final speed

### **Solution:**
1. Convert mass: 58 g = 0.058 kg
2. Direction change means Δv = v_f - (-v_i)
3. Using impulse:
```
J = mΔv ⇒ 0.5 = 0.058(v_f - (-30))
v_f = (0.5/0.058) - 30 ≈ 8.6 - 30 = -21.4 m/s
```

**Final Answer (b):**
Ball returns at **21 m/s** left (negative indicates direction change)

Here are the solutions following the standardized format:

**Part (a):** Speed after collision

### **Solution:**
**Conservation of momentum:**
```
m₁v₁ + m₂v₂ = (m₁ + m₂)v_f
(39 × 4.5) + (45 × 0) = (39 + 45)v_f
175.5 = 84v_f
v_f ≈ 2.09 m/s
```

**Final Answer (a):**
They move off together at **2.1 m/s**

```
2. Final KE (combined):
```
KE_f = ½ × 84 × (2.09)² ≈ 183.3 J
```
3. Energy converted:
```
Fraction = (394.9 - 183.3)/394.9 ≈ 0.536
```

**Final Answer (b):**
**54%** of initial KE is converted to other forms

### **Question 4:**
Marcus (45 kg at 2.5 m/s north) and Laurence (39 kg at 3.0 m/s N45°E) collide inelastically.

### **Solution:**
**Step 1: Resolve velocities**
- Marcus (north only):
  ```
  p_y = 45 × 2.5 = 112.5 kg·m/s
  ```
- Laurence:
  ```
  p_x = 39 × 3.0 × cos45° ≈ 82.7 kg·m/s (east)
  p_y = 39 × 3.0 × sin45° ≈ 82.7 kg·m/s (north)
  ```

**Step 2: Combined momentum**
```
p_total_x = 82.7 kg·m/s
p_total_y = 112.5 + 82.7 = 195.2 kg·m/s
p_total = √(82.7² + 195.2²) ≈ 212.0 kg·m/s
```

**Step 3: Final velocity**
```
v = p_total/(m₁ + m₂) = 212.0/84 ≈ 2.52 m/s
θ = tan⁻¹(195.2/82.7) ≈ 67° north of east
```

**Final Answer:**
They move at **2.5 m/s** at **67° north of east**

### **Question 1:**  
A 70 kg basketball player lands on the ground after a jump at a speed of 10 m/s and is brought to a stop by the ground in 0.35 s. What is the average force exerted on her by the ground?  

**Answer:**  
```
Given:  
- Mass (m) = 70 kg  
- Initial velocity (u) = 10 m/s  
- Final velocity (v) = 0 m/s  
- Time (Δt) = 0.35 s  

First, find acceleration (a):  
a = (v - u) / Δt  
a = (0 - 10) / 0.35  
a ≈ -28.57 m/s² (deceleration)  

Now, calculate force (F):  
F = ma  
F = 70 × (-28.57)  
F ≈ -2000 N  

The negative sign indicates the force opposes motion.  
The average force exerted by the ground is **2000 N** (upwards).  
```  

---  

### **Question 2:**  
A sprinter with a mass of 60 kg leaves the blocks at the start of a race by pushing off with a force of 700 N exerted over a 0.4 s interval of time. At what speed does the sprinter leave the blocks?  

**Answer:**  
```
Given:  
- Mass (m) = 60 kg  
- Force (F) = 700 N  
- Time (Δt) = 0.4 s  

First, find impulse (J):  
J = F × Δt  
J = 700 × 0.4  
J = 280 N·s  

Impulse equals change in momentum (J = Δp = mΔv):  
280 = 60 × (v - 0)  
v = 280 / 60  
v ≈ 4.67 m/s  

The sprinter leaves the blocks at **4.67 m/s**.  
```  

---  

### **Question 3:**  
A 60 kg trampolinist jumps straight up in the air by exerting an average force of 1060 N on the trampoline bed for a time of 0.5 s.  

**(a) What is the impulse of the trampolinist on the trampoline?**  
```
Impulse (J) = F × Δt  
J = 1060 × 0.5  
J = 530 N·s  

The impulse is **530 N·s** (upwards).  
```  

**(b) At what speed does he leave the trampoline?**  
```
Impulse equals change in momentum (J = mΔv):  
530 = 60 × (v - 0)  
v = 530 / 60  
v ≈ 8.83 m/s  

He leaves the trampoline at **8.83 m/s**.  
```  

**(c) What will be the maximum height that he reaches?**  
```
Using kinematic equation:  
v² = u² + 2as  
At max height, v = 0, u = 8.83 m/s, a = -g = -9.81 m/s²  

0 = (8.83)² + 2(-9.81)s  
s = (8.83)² / (2 × 9.81)  
s ≈ 3.98 m  

The maximum height reached is **3.98 m**.  
```

### **Question 4:**  
A collision occurs between two model cars:  
- Car A: 5.0 kg, 2.0 m/s (east)  
- Car B: 5.0 kg, 1.0 m/s (east)  
They lock together after the collision.  

**(a) Total momentum before the collision?**  
```
p_total = m₁u₁ + m₂u₂  
p_total = (5 × 2) + (5 × 1)  
p_total = 10 + 5 = 15 kg·m/s  

Total momentum before collision: **15 kg·m/s (east)**.  
```  

**(b) Velocity after collision?**  
```
Conservation of momentum:  
m₁u₁ + m₂u₂ = (m₁ + m₂)v  
15 = (5 + 5)v  
v = 15 / 10  
v = 1.5 m/s  

Final velocity: **1.5 m/s (east)**.  
```  

**(c) Change in momentum of the faster car (Car A)?**  
```
Δp_A = m_A(v - u_A)  
Δp_A = 5(1.5 - 2)  
Δp_A = -2.5 kg·m/s  

Change in momentum: **-2.5 kg·m/s** (westward change).  
```  

**(d) Change in momentum of the slower car (Car B)?**  
```
Δp_B = m_B(v - u_B)  
Δp_B = 5(1.5 - 1)  
Δp_B = +2.5 kg·m/s  

Change in momentum: **+2.5 kg·m/s** (eastward change).  
```  

**(e) Magnitude of impulse on both cars?**  
```
Impulse = Δp  
For Car A: |Δp_A| = 2.5 N·s  
For Car B: |Δp_B| = 2.5 N·s  

Magnitude of impulse on each car: **2.5 N·s**.  
```  

**(f) How are the impulses different?**  
```
The impulses are equal in magnitude (2.5 N·s) but opposite in direction:  
- Car A experiences a westward impulse (slows down).  
- Car B experiences an eastward impulse (speeds up).  
```  


## Components of momentum
Here's the improved solution with clearer structure and additional explanations:

### **Question:**  
A 5 kg ball moving due east at 4.0 m/s collides with a 4.0 kg ball moving due west at 3.0 m/s. After collision, the 5.0 kg ball moves south at 1.2 m/s.  
(a) What is the speed of the 4.0 kg ball after collision?  
(b) What is its direction of motion?  

---

### **Solution:**

#### **Key Concepts:**
1. **Momentum Conservation:** Total momentum before = total momentum after (both x and y components)
2. **Vector Components:** Analyze motion separately in east-west (x) and north-south (y) directions

#### **Given Data:**
- **Ball A (5 kg):**
  - Initial: 4.0 m/s east (x-direction)
  - Final: 1.2 m/s south (-y-direction)
- **Ball B (4 kg):**
  - Initial: 3.0 m/s west (-x-direction)
  - Final: Unknown velocity (v_B)

---

### **Part (a): Calculating Final Speed**

**Step 1: X-component Analysis**  
Before collision:  
- Ball A: 5 kg × 4.0 m/s = +20 kg·m/s  
- Ball B: 4 kg × (-3.0 m/s) = -12 kg·m/s  
Total x-momentum = 8 kg·m/s  

After collision:  
- Ball A has no x-velocity (moving purely south)  
- So Ball B must carry all x-momentum:  
  4 kg × v_Bx = 8 kg·m/s  
  ⇒ v_Bx = 2.0 m/s (east)

**Step 2: Y-component Analysis**  
Before collision:  
- Both balls have zero y-momentum  

After collision:  
- Ball A: 5 kg × (-1.2 m/s) = -6 kg·m/s  
- Ball B must balance this:  
  4 kg × v_By = +6 kg·m/s  
  ⇒ v_By = 1.5 m/s (north)

**Step 3: Resultant Velocity**  
v_B = √(2.0² + 1.5²) = √6.25 = 2.5 m/s  

**Final Answer (a):**  
The 4.0 kg ball moves at **2.5 m/s** after collision.

---

### **Part (b): Determining Direction**

Using trigonometry:  
tanθ = (north component)/(east component) = 1.5/2.0 = 0.75  
θ = tan⁻¹(0.75) ≈ 36.9°  

**Final Answer (b):**  
The ball moves **36.9° north of east**.

---

### **Verification:**
- **X-momentum check:** 20 - 12 = 8 (before) vs. 4×2.0 = 8 (after) ✓  
- **Y-momentum check:** 0 (before) vs. -6 + 6 = 0 (after) ✓  
- **Energy note:** Kinetic energy is not conserved (inelastic collision)

**6.3 Exercise 1**
**Question:**
A 5 kg ball moving due east at 4.0 m/s collides with a 4.0 kg ball moving due west at 3.0 m/s. Just after the collision, the 5.0 kg ball has a velocity of 1.2 m/s due south.
(a) What is the magnitude of the 4.0 kg ball's velocity just after the collision?
(b) In what direction does it move?

**Solution:**

**Given:**
- Ball A (5 kg):
  - Initial velocity (east): uₐ = +4.0 m/s
  - Final velocity (south): vₐ = -1.2 m/s ĵ
- Ball B (4 kg):
  - Initial velocity (west): uᵦ = -3.0 m/s
  - Final velocity: vᵦ = ?

**Step 1: Conservation of Momentum in x-direction (east-west)**
Initial momentum = Final momentum
mₐuₐₓ + mᵦuᵦₓ = mₐvₐₓ + mᵦvᵦₓ
(5)(4) + (4)(-3) = (5)(0) + (4)(vᵦₓ)
20 - 12 = 4vᵦₓ
vᵦₓ = 2.0 m/s (east)

**Step 2: Conservation of Momentum in y-direction (north-south)**
Initial momentum = Final momentum
mₐuₐᵧ + mᵦuᵦᵧ = mₐvₐᵧ + mᵦvᵦᵧ
0 + 0 = (5)(-1.2) + (4)(vᵦᵧ)
-6 = 4vᵦᵧ
vᵦᵧ = 1.5 m/s (north)

**Step 3: Calculate Resultant Velocity**
Magnitude:
vᵦ = √(vᵦₓ² + vᵦᵧ²) = √(2.0² + 1.5²) = √6.25 = 2.5 m/s

Direction:
θ = tan⁻¹(vᵦᵧ/vᵦₓ) = tan⁻¹(1.5/2.0) ≈ 36.9° north of east

**Answers:**
(a) The magnitude of the 4.0 kg ball's velocity is **2.5 m/s**.
(b) The direction is **36.9° north of east**.

**Verification:**
- Total initial momentum (x): (5×4)+(4×-3) = 8 kg·m/s
- Total final momentum (x): (4×2.0) = 8 kg·m/s ✓
- Total initial momentum (y): 0 kg·m/s
- Total final momentum (y): (5×-1.2)+(4×1.5) = 0 kg·m/s ✓

## Elastic and inelastic collisions

**6.5 Exercise 1**
**Question:**
A 2 kg dynamics cart travelling at 2 m/s collides with a 3 kg dynamics cart travelling in the opposite direction at 4 m/s. If the 2 kg cart rebounds from the collision at 3 m/s, determine:
(a) the velocity of the 3 kg cart after collision
(b) whether this was an elastic collision.

**Solution:**

**Given:**
- Cart A (2 kg):
  - Initial velocity: u₁ = +2 m/s
  - Final velocity: v₁ = -3 m/s (rebound)
- Cart B (3 kg):
  - Initial velocity: u₂ = -4 m/s (opposite direction)
  - Final velocity: v₂ = ?

**Part (a): Velocity of the 3 kg cart after collision**

Using conservation of momentum:
m₁u₁ + m₂u₂ = m₁v₁ + m₂v₂
(2)(2) + (3)(-4) = (2)(-3) + (3)(v₂)
4 - 12 = -6 + 3v₂
-8 + 6 = 3v₂
v₂ = -2/3 ≈ -0.67 m/s

**Answer (a):**
The 3 kg cart moves at **0.67 m/s** in its original direction (west).

**Part (b): Check if collision is elastic**

Calculate total kinetic energy before and after collision.

Initial KE:
KE_initial = ½m₁u₁² + ½m₂u₂²
= ½(2)(2)² + ½(3)(4)²
= 4 + 24 = 28 J

Final KE:
KE_final = ½m₁v₁² + ½m₂v₂²
= ½(2)(3)² + ½(3)(0.67)²
= 9 + 0.67 ≈ 9.67 J

**Answer (b):**
Since KE_initial (28 J) ≠ KE_final (9.67 J), this was **not an elastic collision**.

**Verification:**
- Momentum conservation check:
  Initial: (2×2)+(3×-4) = -8 kg·m/s
  Final: (2×-3)+(3×-0.67) ≈ -8 kg·m/s ✓
- Energy loss: 28 J → 9.67 J (significant energy loss)

### **Question 10: Car Collision with Tree**
**Given:**
- Mass (m) = 1400 kg
- Initial velocity (v₀) = 60 km/h = 16.67 m/s
- Final velocity (v) = 0 m/s
- Time (Δt) = 0.080 s

**(a) Impulse applied to car:**
```
Impulse = Δp = mΔv
= 1400 × (0 - 16.67)
= -23,338 N·s (opposite to initial motion)
```

**(b) Force exerted by tree:**
```
F = Δp/Δt = -23,338/0.080
= -291,725 N ≈ -2.92×10⁵ N (decelerating force)
```

**(c) Driver deceleration (70 kg):**
```
a = Δv/Δt = (0 - 16.67)/0.080
= -208.4 m/s² ≈ -210 m/s² (21g deceleration)
```

### **Question 11: Seatbelt Analysis**
**(a) Impulse for belted occupant:**
```
Area under F-t curve ≈ 600 N × 0.10 s = 60 N·s
```

**(b) Initial car speed:**
```
Impulse = mΔv ⇒ 60 = 60 × v ⇒ v = 1 m/s
```

**(c) Mass comparison:**
```
Unbelted occupant shows higher peak force (800N vs 600N) but shorter duration,
suggesting smaller mass (F = ma ⇒ m = F/a). The curves differ because:
- Belted: Gradual force increase over longer time
- Unbelted: Sharp spike from sudden stop
```

---
### **Question 12: Basketballer Landing**
**(a) Total impulse:**
```
Δp = mΔv = 75 × (0 - 3.2) = -240 N·s (upwards)
```

**(b) Ground force:**
```
F = Δp/Δt = 240/0.10 = 2400 N
```

---
### **Question 13: Safety Features**
```
(a) Padding increases Δt, reducing F (Δp = FΔt)
(b) Crumpling increases collision time, reducing peak force
(c) Helmets extend stopping time for head, reducing impact force
All utilize impulse-momentum principle (FΔt = mΔv)
```

---
### **Question 14: Seatbelt Misconception**
```
Seatbelts don't prevent forward motion but rather:
1. Distribute forces over stronger body parts
2. Extend stopping time to reduce peak force
3. Prevent secondary collisions with interior
```

---
### **Question 16: Toy Car Collision**
**(a) Δp of toy car:**
```
Δp = m(v_f - v_i) = 2.0(-0.50 - 1.0) = -3.0 kg·m/s
```

**(b) Impulse on wall:**
```
+3.0 N·s (Newton's 3rd Law: equal & opposite)
```

**(c) Wall movement:**
```
Theoretically yes, but imperceptibly small due to wall's enormous mass compared to toy car.
```

---
### **Question 17: Cart Experiments**
**(a) Final velocity (2kg + 2kg):**
```
Conservation of momentum:
2×0.60 = (2+2)v ⇒ v = 0.30 m/s
```

**(b) Sand pouring cart:**
```
Mass changes continuously but momentum conserved:
2×0.60 = (2-Δm)v ⇒ v increases as m decreases
```

---
### **Question 19: Rollerblade Collision**
**(a) Andrew's speed:**
```
60×2.0 = 70×v ⇒ v = 1.71 m/s
```

**(b) Impulse on Gavin:**
```
Δp = 60×(0 - 2.0) = -120 N·s
```

**(f) Combined motion:**
```
60×2.0 = (60+70)v ⇒ v = 0.92 m/s
```

---
### **Question 22: Train and Coal Cart**
```
Conservation of momentum:
(4.0×10⁶×3.0) + (5×10⁵×2.0) = (4.5×10⁶)v
⇒ v = (12 + 1)/4.5 = 2.89 m/s
```

---
### **Question 28: Elastic Hockey Puck Collision**
```
For elastic collisions of equal mass:
v₁' = v₂ = 5 m/s
v₂' = v₁ = 10 m/s
(They exchange velocities)

# Summary: Momentum, Impulse, and Collisions

## 🔹 Momentum
- **Momentum (p)** is the product of an object's **mass (m)** and **velocity (v)**:  
  `p = m × v`
- It is a **vector quantity** (has both magnitude and direction).
- The more mass or speed an object has, the more momentum it carries.

## 🔹 Impulse
- **Impulse (J)** is the product of **force (F)** and **time (Δt)** during which the force acts:  
  `J = F × Δt`
- Impulse equals the **change in momentum** of an object:  
  `F × Δt = m × Δv`
- Impulse can also be found as the **area under a force vs. time graph**.

## 🔹 Real-Life Application: Safety and Force Reduction
- Increasing the **time** over which momentum changes **reduces the net force** experienced.
- Safety features in cars (e.g., **crumple zones**, **seatbelts**, **airbags**) extend the time of impact and reduce injury.
- Driving at lower speeds (e.g., in school zones with **speed humps**) means less momentum and lower collision impact.

## 🔹 Law of Conservation of Momentum
- If **net external force = 0**, then **total momentum stays constant**:
  `∑p_before = ∑p_after`
- Applies to **1D**, **2D**, and **3D** systems.
- In any collision, forces between two bodies are **equal and opposite** (Newton’s Third Law).

## 🔹 Collisions
| Collision Type          | Momentum Conserved | Kinetic Energy Conserved | Description                               |
|-------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Inelastic**           | ✅                 | ❌                        | Objects may stick together; some KE lost  |
| **Elastic**             | ✅                 | ✅                        | Both KE and momentum conserved            |

- **Kinetic Energy (Ek)** is given by:  
  `Ek = ½ × m × v²`  
  - Measured in **joules (J)**  
  - Depends on **mass** and the **square of velocity**

## 📝 Key Takeaways
- Momentum and impulse help explain **how and why objects move or stop**.
- **Impulse = change in momentum**, and extending time reduces force.
- **Momentum is always conserved** (if no external force).
- Only in **elastic collisions** is **kinetic energy also conserved**.
- Physics explains not just motion—but **how we design safer vehicles and environments**.
