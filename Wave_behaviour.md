## 8.1.2 – Echo and Distance

### **Concepts**

* Speed of sound in air ≈ 343 m/s
* Echo involves sound travelling to a surface and back (total distance is twice one-way distance)

### **Calculation**

$$
\text{Time} = 2.0\ \text{s} \\
\text{Distance} = \frac{v \times t}{2} = \frac{343 \times 2.0}{2} = 343\ \text{m}
$$

### **Constraints**

* Assumes no wind or temperature variation affecting sound speed.

### **Conclusion**

An echo heard after 2.0 seconds indicates the reflecting surface is 343 m away.

### **Answer Box**

**The reflecting surface is 343 m away.**

## 8.1.4 – Mirror Height and Full-Body Reflection

### **Concepts**

* Law of reflection: $\theta_i = \theta_r$
* Ray diagrams: incident and reflected rays form equal angles

### **Sketch Concept**

Draw a person in front of a vertical mirror. Rays from feet and head reflect at equal angles. The point of incidence for both rays lies halfway up the mirror height.

### **Conclusion**

You only need a mirror half your height to see your entire body due to equal angles of incidence and reflection.

### **Answer Box**

**A mirror half your height is sufficient because reflected rays obey $\theta_i = \theta_r$ and meet your eye from head and feet.**

## 8.2.1 – Colour of a Towel Underwater

### **Concepts**

* Refraction alters direction and speed, not frequency
* Colour depends on frequency

### **Explanation**

Light slows in water, changing wavelength and direction. However, frequency (and thus colour perception) remains constant.

### **Conclusion**

The towel appears the same colour underwater because frequency is unchanged.

### **Answer Box**

**Colour remains the same underwater because light's frequency—and therefore its colour—is unchanged.**

---

## 8.2.4 – Spearing a Fish

### **Concepts**

* Refraction: light bends when passing between water and air
* Apparent depth ≠ real depth

### **Explanation**

Due to refraction, the fish appears higher than it actually is. If the hunter compensates by aiming below, they can hit the fish.

### **Conclusion**

The hunter may still hit the fish due to adjusting for refraction-induced displacement.

### **Answer Box**

**Refraction causes the fish to appear higher, so aiming below can compensate and still be successful.**

---

## 8.2.5 – Wave Slows in New Medium

### **Concepts**

* $v = f \lambda$
* Speed $v$ changes, but frequency $f$ stays constant in a new medium

### **Calculation**

$$
v' = \frac{v}{2} \Rightarrow \lambda' = \frac{v'}{f} = \frac{v/2}{f} = \frac{\lambda}{2}
$$

### **Conclusion**

Wavelength halves, frequency remains unchanged.

### **Answer Box**

**The wave’s wavelength halves, but the frequency remains constant.**

## 8.3.2 – Dolphin Echolocation

### **Concepts**

* Resolution limit ≈ half of wavelength
* $v_{\text{seawater}} \approx 1500\ \text{m/s}$

### **Calculation**

$$
f = 30,000\ \text{Hz} \\
\lambda = \frac{v}{f} = \frac{1500}{30,000} = 0.05\ \text{m} \\
\text{Min detectable size} ≈ \frac{\lambda}{2} = 0.025\ \text{m} = 2.5\ \text{cm}
$$

### **Conclusion**

The dolphin can detect objects about 2.5 cm or larger.

### **Answer Box**

**Smallest detectable object is approximately 2.5 cm.**

## 8.3.3 – Diffraction of Visible Light

### **Concepts**

* Diffraction requires obstacle/slit ≈ wavelength
* Visible light: $\lambda = 400\text{–}800 \times 10^{-9}\ \text{m}$

### **Comparison Table**

| Wave Type     | Wavelength (m) | Common Obstacle Size (m) | Noticeable Diffraction? |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Visible light | $\sim 10^{-7}$ | $\sim 10^{-3}$           | No                      |
| Water waves   | $\sim 1$       | $\sim 1$                 | Yes                     |

### **Constraints**

* Everyday gaps/objects too large compared to light wavelength

### **Conclusion**

Diffraction is negligible for visible light due to small wavelength.

### **Answer Box**

**Visible light doesn’t noticeably diffract around everyday objects because its wavelength is extremely small.**

---

## 8.3.4 – Diffraction and Radio Waves

### **Concepts**

* $\lambda = \frac{v}{f}$, $v = 3 \times 10^8\ \text{m/s}$
* Greater wavelength ⇒ greater diffraction

### **Calculation Table**

| Transmission | Frequency          | Wavelength      |
| ------------ | ------------------ | --------------- |
| AM Radio     | $1 \times 10^6$ Hz | $300\ \text{m}$ |
| FM Radio     | $1 \times 10^8$ Hz | $3\ \text{m}$   |
| Digital TV   | $6 \times 10^8$ Hz | $0.5\ \text{m}$ |

### **Conclusion**

AM waves diffract more due to their longer wavelength, making them less affected by obstacles.

### **Answer Box**

**AM radio diffracts more due to its long wavelength (\~300 m), allowing it to bend around obstacles better than FM or TV signals.**

## 8.4.2 – Resultant Displacement from Superposition

### **Concepts**

* Superposition Principle

### **Calculation**

$$
\text{Resultant} = y_1 + y_2
$$

### **Answer Box**

**Add the displacements algebraically: $y_{\text{total}} = y_1 + y_2$.**

---

## 8.4.3 – Speed After Superposition

### **Concepts**

* Wave speed depends on medium properties
* Superposition is temporary

### **Conclusion**

Wave speed of each component remains unchanged after superposition.

### **Answer Box**

**No, wave speed remains unchanged after superposition.**

---

## 8.5.3 – Speed of Reflected Waves

### **Concepts**

* Wave speed determined by medium, not direction

### **Conclusion**

Reflected waves travel at the same speed as incident waves in the same medium.

### **Answer Box**

**Yes, reflected waves move at the same speed as incident waves in the same medium.**

---

## 8.5.4 – Standing Wave Displacement Points

### **Concepts**

* Antinode: max displacement
* Node: zero displacement

### **Answer Box**

**a: Antinode
b: Node**

---

## 8.5.5 – Method to Find Wave Speed in Spring

### **Concepts**

* $v = f \lambda$
* Standing wave patterns used to find $\lambda$

### **Method**

1. Vibrate the spring with known frequency using a mechanical oscillator.
2. Measure the distance between nodes ⇒ half-wavelength.
3. Use formula:

$$
v = f \lambda
$$

### **Answer Box**

**Use a known frequency to create standing waves and measure wavelength; apply $v = f \lambda$ to calculate wave speed.**

# Summary

## Key Concepts

- **Superposition**: The addition of amplitudes of two or more waves passing through the same point.
- **Interference**:
  - *Destructive Interference*: Addition of two wave disturbances resulting in a reduced amplitude.
  - *Constructive Interference*: Addition of two wave disturbances resulting in an increased amplitude.
- **Reflection**: The return of a wave into its original medium upon striking a barrier or reaching the medium's end.
- **Standing Waves**: Caused by the superposition of two wave trains with the same frequency traveling in opposite directions.
  - *Nodes*: Points of least disturbance.
  - *Antinodes*: Points of maximum disturbance.
- **Diffraction**: The bending or spreading of waves as they pass through a small opening or move past an edge.
- **Refraction**: The change in wave direction when entering a medium with a different wave speed.
- **Resonance**: A medium vibrates at the same frequency as an external periodic force applied to it.

## Principles and Observations

1. **Reflection**:  
   - Waves obey the law of reflection:  
     * Law of reflection: $\theta_i = \theta_r$

2. **Refraction**:  
   - Occurs when waves change speed upon entering a different medium at an angle ≠ 90°.

3. **Diffraction**:  
   - Waves spread out after passing through a narrow opening.  
   - Diffraction increases as the opening width decreases.

4. **Interference**:  
   - *Constructive*: Two waves combine to form a larger amplitude.  
   - *Destructive*: Two waves combine to form a smaller amplitude.

5. **Standing Waves**:  
   - Result from superposition of two continuous waves with the same frequency and amplitude traveling in opposite directions.  
   - **Nodes**: Points with no displacement.  
   - **Antinodes**: Points with maximum displacement.

6. **Resonance**:  
   - Objects vibrate at their natural frequency.  
   - Resonance occurs when an external driving force matches the system's natural frequency.
